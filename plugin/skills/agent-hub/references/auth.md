# Auth — API Key Resolution, Config Locations, Fallbacks

Agent Hub runs as a **multi-user, multi-org** system. Every JWT carries a
`uid` (user id) claim alongside the user's current org context. Membership
in an org determines what that user can do; requests outside any org they
belong to return `403` (except the `x-api-key` break-glass header, which
the server treats as Owner for all orgs — use it only for emergencies and
automation).

## Role hierarchy

Three-tier hierarchy (`server/roles.ts`): **Owner** > **Admin** > **User**.
Checks are hierarchical — Owner satisfies any `requireRole('X')`. Never
compare role strings directly; use the server's `hasAtLeastRole` /
`requireRole` helpers server-side, and call the right endpoint
client-side.

## Sole-Owner protection

The server refuses to delete or demote the last Owner of an org
(`countOwnersForOrg(orgId) <= 1` guard on `DELETE /users/:id` and role
changes). If you need to hand off Owner, promote someone else to Owner
first, then demote yourself.

## API key resolution for scripts

Every wrapper under `scripts/` resolves the key through
`scripts/_common.sh` in this order:

1. `AGENT_HUB_API_KEY` environment variable (injected into sessions by
   the server — this is the normal path).
2. `x-api-key` value pulled from `~/.agent-hub/data/config.json`
   (`apiKey` field) if the env var is unset.
3. Empty — requests fall through to whatever JWT cookie the caller may
   carry. Most agent-side calls will `401` in this state; re-source the
   environment.

All wrappers send the resolved key as `x-api-key: <key>` and treat a
missing key as a recoverable error, not a fatal one.

## Config locations

- **Primary**: `~/.agent-hub/data/config.json` — port, CLI binary paths
  (`claudeBin`, `cursorBin`), `defaultCwd`, `apiKey`.
- **Legacy fallback**: `server/config.json` — read only when the data-dir
  copy is missing. Kept for backwards compatibility with older
  single-user installs.
- **Env overrides**: `PORT`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `DATA_DIR`, `PUBLIC_URL`
  override the on-disk values at process start.

## Endpoints at a glance

Prefix everything with `/api/auth`. All require auth unless flagged
**public**.

| Endpoint                                       | Min role     | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET  /status`, `POST /setup`, `POST /login`   | public       | bootstrap + sign-in                      |
| `GET  /me`                                     | any          | current user + role                      |
| `GET  /users`                                  | Admin        | list org members                         |
| `POST /users`                                  | Owner        | create user + membership                 |
| `PUT  /users/:id/role`                         | Admin        | change role (sole-Owner guard applies)   |
| `DELETE /users/:id`                            | Owner        | remove user (sole-Owner guard)           |
| `POST /users/:id/password`                     | self/Owner   | reset password                           |
| `POST /invites`, `GET /invites`, `DELETE …`    | Admin        | invite lifecycle                         |
| `GET  /invites/:token`                         | **public**   | preview invite before accepting          |
| `POST /invites/:token/accept`                  | **public**   | redeem invite (per-IP rate-limited)      |
| `POST /logout`                                 | any          | revoke session                           |

Public paths live in `PUBLIC_PATHS` / `PUBLIC_PREFIXES` (`server/auth.ts`);
everything else falls through `authMiddleware`.

## JWT `uid` claim & pre-migration fallback

The `uid` claim identifies the user across org switches. Pre-migration
tokens that pre-date the claim are still accepted by `authMiddleware` for
backward compatibility, but newly minted tokens always carry `uid`.

## Rate limiting — `trust proxy` is coupled to the proxy topology

`server/index.ts` sets `app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback')` so `req.ip`
resolves via `X-Forwarded-For` from a local nginx (127.0.0.1). This is
what lets per-IP login / invite-accept rate limiters see the real client
IP.

If the topology ever changes (moving behind an ALB, Cloudflare, or any
non-loopback proxy), this value must be revisited — `'loopback'` will
drop the forwarded IP outside 127.0.0.1 and per-IP limits will collapse
to a single bucket.
